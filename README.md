# lritter's Dotfiles

This is where I keep all my dotfiles, preferences, useful shell scripts, etc.

Normally I keep my dotfiles checked out to `~/.dotfiles` and I symlink particular files in my home directory to files in my dotfiles directory.

TODO: Script the symlinking.

The directory layout is fairly self-explanatory and I try to comment the dotfiles so I can remember why I actually did what I did...
